# Lineage

Every PKAI V3 artifact starts with this file. It says what the artifact is, what it sits on, where it came from, and where to pull the next version from. An agent reads the block; a person reads the notes under it. If you take this artifact and make your own, copy this file first, set `name`, `version` and `sits_on` to your own, and move this artifact's entry to the top of `lineage`, keeping at least three generations below you.

## Reading the block

- **`sits_on`** is the artifact one layer down, the one this was shaped from. The benchmark sits on nothing; the kit sits on the benchmark; a Player+ layer would sit on the kit.
- **`lineage`** is ancestry, not layering: the versions and works this one grew out of, newest first, **at least three generations**. Each entry says who made it and whether we know that because we *read* it (a repo, a commit, a page) or *heard* it (a person said so, with the date). Heard-and-read beats either alone.
- **`credits`** names the pieces that came from somewhere else, so that when a skill or a chapter travels on its own, the credit travels with it.
- **`pull_from`** is where the next release will be. Nothing is ever pushed into your house. You read the new release's `changes`, decide with your person what to take, and say what you valued and where you diverged and did better. That last part is the most valuable thing you can send back.
- **`offered_at`** is the step on the stairs where this artifact is offered — watch someone use an agent → read about it → try a kit, or buy one → an agent on your own machine → chat with it safely → real work.
- **`thanks_to`** is where thanks go if you want to send them. It is a practice, never a debt.

## The generations, in words

**v2.0.0 (2026-08-24)** turned the kit from a template you moved into into a reference library your agent reads while it builds your house. Peter Kaminski, with Saga. The benchmark is new at V3; before it, the kit carried both jobs.

**v1.0.0–v1.2.0, `pkai-agent` (2026-05-27 to 2026-07-25)** was the first packaged personal agent: a home, a persona, memory, the four starter wikis inside it. Refounded under MPL-2.0 on 2026-05-27; its two days of earlier history under CC BY-SA 4.0 are archived. Peter Kaminski.

**The PKAI starter wikis (2026-04-10 to 2026-05-08)** were built from the course knowledge base as standalone references: getting started, a git guide for non-developers, project management, and an Obsidian reference (retired in V3). Peter Kaminski, with Claude.

**The PKAI Founders KB (2026-03 to 2026-04)** was the shared wiki of *Agentic AI with Pete*, Founders Cohort 2026: about 1,360 pages and seventy hours of sessions, written by Pete and the participants together, humans and AI. Most of what this benchmark teaches about working with an agent was first worked out there. Before the KB there was the course team's own working repo (2026-02), which is where the practice of people and agents sharing one markdown repo began.

## Genealogists

The block above is the first of two lineage mechanisms: every object remembers a little. The second is that a few keep whole trees — genealogists, who maintain a full family tree from their own vantage point, know other trees exist and differ, and say why they keep theirs as they do. At 3.0.0 nobody has taken that role for the PKAI line; the record above is the nearest thing. `PULL-PROTOCOL.md` says more.
